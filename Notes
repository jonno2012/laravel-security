URLS
-----
- Hackers can add URLs to their dodgy resource in the quert params.
- PHP will accept an array from query params.
- returning a 404 instead of a 403 will hide the existence of resources from unauthorised users.
- hackers will try and change the field name of forms to, for example, 'admin', where they would set it to '1'.
- validation over 'fillable' can be preferable because the lack of flexibility of using $fillable can lead devs to
allow the inclusion of all fields in input where those excess  fields are not even required. For example it may be an 'admin'
field which gives a user elevated privileges.






Checklist
----------
- Make sure dev mode isn't running in prod. APP_DEBUG, APP_ENV (change from local)
- Make sure they can't access telescope. What about the 403 page that it presents when it is not in local mode?
- Change the generic validation messages? this could allow them to figure out you are using laravel.
- Make sure to put gates on the seeing the form as well as being able to submit a request via the form.
- Use policies where necessary
- Make sure attributes in $fillable aren't being allowed in input where they are not needed and where the validation
is being handled by $fillable attribute as opposed to explicit validation on the request level.
- Ensure that anything in $fillable isn't being included in input.
- Filter data using validation rules. See UserController > store
- consider using the Rules\Password::default() or define your own rules in the AuthServiceProvider
- consider using the ->unCompromised() validation rule.

Useful Commands
